During Rehabilitation it is most likely that there will be many individuals working with you. Each of these individuals is from different specialties. It is essential that you get to know the health care team and feel comfortable addressing any issue that arises during the recovery process. Services delivered during rehabilitation may comprise of physical, occupational, and speech therapies, and recreation therapy. See the information below for a more detailed description of what the purpose of each specialty is.

Physical Therapy (PT) helps restore physical functioning such as walking, range of motion, and strength. PT will address impaired balance, partial or one-sided paralysis, and foot drop. During PT sessions, you will work on functional tasks such as bed mobility, transfers, and standing/ambulation. Each session is tailored to your individual needs.

Occupational Therapy (OT) involves re-learning the skills used in everyday living. These skills include but are not limited to: dressing, bathing, eating, and going to the bathroom. OT will teach you alternate strategies that will make everyday skills less taxing and set you up for success in self care.

Speech Therapy (ST or SLT) helps reduce or compensate for problems in speech that may arise secondary to the stroke. These problems could include communicating, swallowing, or thinking. Two conditions known as, dysarthria and aphasia (please see attached definition sheet for descriptions), can cause speech problems among stroke survivors. ST will address these issues as well as thinking problems brought about by the stroke. A therapist will teach you and your family ways to help with these problems.

Recreation Therapy serves the purpose of reintroducing social activities into your life. Activities might include various recreational activities. This service is so important because it opens the opportunity to get back in the community and develop social skills again.

Recurrent Strokes: How to lower your risk

After experiencing a stroke, most efforts are placed on the rehabilitation and recovery process. However, preventing a second stroke from occurring is an important consideration. It is important to know the risk factors of stroke and what you can do to decrease the risk of another stroke. There are two types of risk factors- controllable and uncontrollable. One thing to remember, however, is that just because you have more than one of the uncontrollable risk factors does not make you destined to have another stroke. With adequate attention to the controllable risk factors, the effect of the uncontrollable factors can be greatly reduced.

Uncontrollable Risk Factors:
- Age
- Gender
- Race  
- Family History of stroke
- Family or personal history of diabetes

Controllable Risk Factors:
- High blood pressure
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- Cigarette smoking
- Alcohol consumption
- High blood cholesterol
- Illegal drug use

Please note, everyone has some stroke risk, but making some simple lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of another stroke. Some risk factors cannot be changed such as being over age 55, male, African American, family history of stroke, or personal history or diabetes. From the chart above it is noted that these are risk factors that are uncontrollable.

AGE: the chance of having a stroke increases with age. Stroke risk doubles with each decade past age 55.

GENDER: males have a higher risk than females.

RACE: African-Americans have a higher risk than most other racial groups. This is due to African-Americans having a higher incidence of other factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and smoking.

FAMILY HISTORY: the risk increases with a family history.

FAMILY OR PERSONAL HISTORY OF DIABETES: the increased risk for stroke may be related to circulation problems that occur with diabetes.

Controllable Risk Factors are those that can be affected by lifestyle changes.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE: the most powerful risk factor!! People who have high blood pressure are at 4 to 6 times higher risk than those without high blood pressure. Normal blood pressure is considered to be a systolic pressure of 120 mmHg over a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg. High blood pressure is diagnosed as persistently high pressure greater than 140 over 90 mmHg.

HEART DISEASE: the second most powerful risk factor, especially with a condition of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation causes one part of the heart to beat up to four times faster than the rest of the heart. This condition occurs when the heart beat is irregular which can lead to blood clots that leave the heart and travel to the brain.

DIABETES: Diabetes is another significant risk factor for stroke that affects blood circulation and increases stroke risk.`;
